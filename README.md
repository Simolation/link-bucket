# Link bucket
Sometimes you just want to quickly share a link with friends or colleagues, but it's not practical to send it via WhatsApp or email.
Instead, you could simply create a link bucket and when everyone opened the bucket, you can add your links and they will be shared in real time.
With respect for privacy, the links are not stored on the server. As soon as you close the page, all links are deleted.
